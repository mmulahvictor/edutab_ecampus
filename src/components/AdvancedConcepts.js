                    <li>
                        <h3>Game Design</h3>
                        <p>Learn how to design and build games with Scratch. You will learn how to create user interfaces, player mechanics, and game objectives that are both fun and challenging.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Simulations</h3>
                        <p>Understand how to use Scratch to simulate real-life scenarios. You will learn how to create models of systems, such as weather patterns, and understand how to make them interact with each other.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Collision Detection</h3>
                        <p>Discover how to make objects in Scratch interact with each other. You will learn how to detect collisions between sprites and how to trigger events when they happen.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Parallax Scrolling</h3>
                        <p>Learn how to create parallax scrolling effects in Scratch. You will understand how to make backgrounds move at different speeds, creating an illusion of depth in your game or animation.</p>
                    </li>
